--2-What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?
---Add cheese is $1 extra
--3-The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.
--4-Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?
---customer_id
---order_id
---runner_id
---rating
---order_time
---pickup_time
---Time between order and pickup
---Delivery duration
---Average speed
---Total number of pizzas
--5-If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?

from #cleaned_runner_orders
